# Thrawnio's Drawing Project
This was my final project I worked on in the 'Advanced Python' course I pursued at FunTech for a week.

The file Login.py is the window that appears initially that asks for your login details. To access the drawing pad (drawpad.py) you have to enter "sulaiman.nasir" as the username and "funtech" as the password.

Just to caveat, if you run this program on macOS, it will work however the colours of the buttons won't appear. This seems to be an issue beyond my capability of fixing. This is how it looks on macOS:
